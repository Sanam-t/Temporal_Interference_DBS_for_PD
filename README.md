# Temporal Interference DBS for Parkinson's Disease
## Noninvasive Deep Brain Stimulation via Temporally Interfering Electric Fields for Parkinson's Disease
Parkinson’s disease affects a significant global population of approximately 7 to 10 million individuals. While a cure for Parkinson’s disease remains elusive, effective management of its symptoms can be achieved through non-invasive Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). This project explores the application of non-invasive DBS, which involves stimulating neurons deep within the brain using multiple electric fields with specific frequencies.

The key concept behind non-invasive DBS is **temporal interference (TI)**. When two waves with slightly different frequencies intersect, they create an enveloping wave characterized by a frequency equivalent to the discrepancy between the original frequencies. By strategically modulating these electric fields, we can stimulate specific brain regions without causing harm to nearby areas.

# Project Overview
