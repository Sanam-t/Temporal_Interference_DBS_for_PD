This repository presents a computational framework for Noninvasive Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) using Temporally Interfering (TI) Electric Fields, specifically designed for treating Parkinson's Disease (PD). It showcases the interdisciplinary approach combining neuroscience, biomedical engineering, and computational modeling.

## Features üåü
- Simulates the effect of TI electric fields on deep brain structures.
- Utilizes MATLAB and Python environments for comprehensive analysis.
- Supports noninvasive DBS research with computational models.
- Aids in understanding the underlying mechanisms of TI electric fields in neural modulation.
